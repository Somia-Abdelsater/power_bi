# Power BI Projects Repository

Welcome to the Power BI Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Power BI projects showcasing various data visualizations and analytics.


## About the Projects

Each project in this repository focuses on a specific Issue that face power BI developer. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Power BI fundamentals or an experienced analyst seeking to sharpen your skills, there's something for everyone in these projects.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a series of Power BI projects that demonstrate different aspects of data visualization, reporting, and analytics using Microsoft Power BI. Each project is designed to showcase different techniques and capabilities of Power BI to transform and visualize data.


## Project List

Here's a brief overview of the projects available in this repository:

### Project 1: [Dynamic Card Values with Field Parameters]

#### Project Description: 

This Power BI project demonstrates the use of field parameters to dynamically adjust card visual values based on selections made in a slicer.

#### Key Features

- **Field Parameters**: Utilizes Power BI's field parameters functionality to enable dynamic selection of data fields.
- **Card Visuals**: Demonstrates the versatility of card visuals in displaying summarized data metrics.
- **Slicers**: Employs slicers to allow users to choose specific data fields, dynamically updating the card visual to reflect the chosen metric.
- **Interactivity**: Enhances user experience by enabling real-time updates based on slicer selections, providing immediate insights into different data perspectives.

#### How It Works

This project leverages Power BI's capability to create field parameters, which act as placeholders for dynamic data fields. By linking these parameters to slicers that contain selectable data columns, users can easily switch between different metrics or dimensions directly affecting the card visual output. For instance, selecting "Order Total" from the slicer updates the card to display the total order amount, whereas selecting "Order Quantity" updates it to show the total Order Quantity sold, and ect .....

#### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Users can effortlessly switch between different data fields without needing to modify the report layout.
- **Enhanced Insights**: Facilitates quick comparisons and analysis across various metrics, enhancing decision-making capabilities.
- **Simplicity**: Provides a straightforward user interface while offering powerful data exploration capabilities.

#### Example Use Cases
we can use the same technique to: 
- **Data translation**: to determines which language is displayed to report consumers.
- **Change Dimension or metrics of visuals**

### Project 3: [Visual Calculations]

#### Project Description: 
Visual calculations allow you to create new calculations directly on a visual using an intuitive, Excel-like interface. This feature simplifies the process of performing calculations by eliminating the need for complex DAX expressions, making it more user-friendly and accessible.
#### Key Benefits of Visual Calculations
•	Simplicity: No more struggling with convoluted DAX code. Visual calculations are straightforward and easy to use.
•	Performance: These calculations operate on aggregated data, which often leads to improved performance compared to traditional measures.
•	Flexibility: You can leverage the visual’s axes and structure for more dynamic and responsive calculations.
#### How to Used
1.	Enable the Feature:
o	Navigate to Options and Settings ➡️ Options ➡️ Preview features.
o	Select Visual Calculations and restart Power BI Desktop.
2.	Choose a Visual:
o	Select the visual where you want to apply the calculation.
3.	Create the Calculation:
o	Click the New Calculation button in the ribbon.
4.	Define the Formula:
o	In the formula bar, type your DAX expression. For example:
	Running Sum: Running sum = RUNNINGSUM([Sales Amount])
#### Used in Project:
•	Matrix Overview and Preview Feature
•	Running Sum
•	Moving Average
•	Percent of Parent
•	Percent of Grand Total
•	Average of Children
•	Versus Previous
•	Versus Next
•	Versus First
•	Versus Last
#### Use Cases
•	Calculate running totals, moving averages, or custom metrics directly on your charts.
•	Simplify complex business logic without cluttering your data model.
